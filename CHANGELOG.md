# 0.3.2

> Feb 20, 2021

- Add matrices.

# 0.3.1

> Feb 19, 2021

- Add the `uniforms!` macro to safely create uniforms.

# 0.3

> Feb 19, 2021

- Add matrices and make `PrimType` a non-exhaustive `enum` so that we can add more types later without breaking the API.

# 0.2

> Feb 15, 2021

- Changed the API to make it easier to use.
- Documented as much things as possible. Itâ€™s likely some things are still missing. They will be added, if any, in minor
  bumps of the library.

# 0.1

> Jan 18, 2021

- Initial revision.
