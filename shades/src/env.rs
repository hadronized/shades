//! Shader environments.
//!
//! An environment is a set of expressions available to a shader stage to manipulate values coming from the outside of
//! the stage. Itâ€™s akin to system environment (i.e. [`std::env::var`]), but for shaders.
//!
//! Environment variables are typically set by the backend technology, such as OpenGL or Vulkan.

/// Environment.
///
/// Environment types must provide [`Environment::Env`], which is the type that will be available on the EDSL side. The
/// reason for that is to authorize creating proc-macro to automatically derive [`Environment`] for their types without
/// having to use [`Expr`] types.
///
/// You can use [`()`] if you do not want to use any environment.
